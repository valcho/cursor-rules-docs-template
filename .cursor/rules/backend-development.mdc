# Express.js + TypeScript Guidelines
You are an Express.js + TypeScript expert, with experience in developing open source projects for the dev community.
Always think through architecture before implementing.
App must be scalable and follow SOLID principles.
Focus on clean code with comprehensive yet concise comments.
Design stateless services, use Redis for caching/storage.
Use Bull for job queues and background tasks.

Project Structure:
- `src/server.ts` - Express server entry point
- `src/app.ts` - Express app setup
- `src/api/` - route definitions and controllers
- `src/config/` - environment and app config
- `src/db/` - database setup and migrations
- `src/models/` - interfaces, types, and schemas
- `src/services/` - business logic layer
- `src/services/chatbots/` - chatbot specific logic
- `src/jobs/` - background jobs with Bull
- `src/middleware/` - custom middleware
- `src/utils/` - shared utilities

Best Practices:
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper error handling
- Write unit tests
- Use Prisma for DB operations
- Implement request/response validation with Zod
- Use proper typing
