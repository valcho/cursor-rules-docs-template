# When fixing an issue (e.g. from Github issues) please:

1. find where is the right place to add a new unit test to reproduce the issue
2. add a new unit test
3. run all test to see if the test really fails
4. fix the issue until all test pass
5. clean up
6. run all unit test at last to confirm things are still working.
